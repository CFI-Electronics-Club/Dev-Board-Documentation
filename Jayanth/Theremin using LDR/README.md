# Theremin using Light-Dependent Resistor
## Description
You might have seen Sheldon playing the Theremin on The Big Bang Theory or heard it on Star Trek. In this project, you will be building a simple Theremin-like setup using a Light-Dependent Resistor and Buzzer.
## Concept
We will duplicate a similar sound as that of a Theremin, digitally using a buzzer controlled by Pulse Width Modulations and a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), for reading the hand movements over it which will be considered as inputs to control the sound coming out of the buzzer.
## Prerequisites
Arduino IDE
## Components
* Electronics Club Custom Development Board (CDB)          
* Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR)             
* Buzzer
* Resistor - 10k
* Jumpers
* Breadboard   
## Schematic
Buzzer Pin 1 --> 4 of CDB             
Buzzer Pin 2 --> GND                    
LDR Leg 1 --> 10k Resistor --> 5 of CDB              
LDR Leg 1 --> VCC           
LDR Leg 2 --> GND               
###### (Note: Leg 1 and Leg 2 are named arbitrarily)
