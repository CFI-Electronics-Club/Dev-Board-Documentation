# Theremin using Light-Dependent Resistor
## Description
You might have seen Sheldon playing the Theremin on The Big Bang Theory or heard it on Star Trek. In this project, you will be building a simple Theremin-like setup using a Light-Dependent Resistor and Buzzer.
## Concept
We will duplicate a similar sound, as that of a Theremin digitally using a buzzer controlled by Pulse Width Modulations and a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), for reading the hand movements over it which will be considered as inputs to control the sound coming out of the buzzer.
