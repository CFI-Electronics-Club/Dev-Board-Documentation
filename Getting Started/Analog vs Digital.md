## Analog v/s Digital Circuits

### Analog 

* All physical quantities are analog.
* Analog means that the quantity can take any value between its
minimum value and maximum value.
* **Example** :  
 i) Temperature, can take any value[-1,12.8,25.002,... etc.]. <br />
 ii) Sine waves are analog.

### Digital

* Digital means that the quantity can take specific levels of values
with specific offset between each other.
* **Example** : <br>
i) English alpha consists of 26 letter, there is no letter between A
and B. <br />
ii) Square waves are Digital.
