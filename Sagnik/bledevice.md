# Detect Presence of BLE Devices
## Description
Proximity sensors can be described as one of a kind switches that detect a nearby object with the help of light, electromagnetic field, or sound. Typically, these types of devices are designed to detect nearby subjects, and often it's the practical application that most of these sensors are going to be used in. But there are circumstances where the subject is far away from the sensor or the subject is blocked by an obstruction, in these types of situations, we can use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices to detect and sense the proximity of the object. The development board has built-in BLE

## Follow up Problem Statement
Using a buzzer, make a sound whenever a BLE device is in close proximity.
