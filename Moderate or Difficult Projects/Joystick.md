# Joystick interfacing
## Description
In this project, we are going to interface HW-504 analog controller module to the laptop and use it in place of the good old WASD gaming controls.
## Concept
Concepts involve the working of the joystick module and the pushbutton trigger. Apart from that, it is just coding and using some special libraries to do the job.
## Components required
* Electronics club custom development board
* HW-504 joystick module 
* Jumper wires
## Libraries required
* BleKeyboard.h

BleKeyboard.h is the header file which is used to provide keystrokes to the laptop via bluetooth. However, this library is not directly installable through the library mamanger. Instead the .zip
